function [ flux_avg, day_length_hr ] = solarFlux(latitude, Ls)
% Description: 
%   Calculate a solar flux estimate [W/m^2] and length of sunlight duration 
%   in [hr] based on mission latitude and time of year
%
% Inputs:   
%    latitude: Geographic latitude of the mission on Mars Surface [deg] (Range between -90 and 90 deg) >> needs more testing on negative values
%    Ls (solar longitude): Angular position of Mars around the Sun [deg], based on time of year  (Range from 0 to 360 deg)
%                           -> Ls = 0Â° corresponds to northern vernal equinox
% Outputs: 
%    flux_avg: Average daily solar flux taken over only the daylight hours  [W/m^2]
%    day_length_hr: Length of daylight hours at the givin surface latitude [hr]
